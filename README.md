# Permutation Groups
I did this project in the 3rd year of my bachelor degree at University of Cambridge as part of abstract algebra coursework. Here we compute the order of a given permutation group by constructing a generating set and applying Orbit-Stabilizer theorem. The file "statement.pdf" and "report.pdf" contain the problem statement and report of the project respectively. The MATLAB codes can be found in the "code" folder.
